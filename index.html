            Technology is the most useful form of science for the general
            population. In simple words, technology is when we take the concepts
            of science and transform them into gadgets and devices that are
            useful to us as human beings. When we look around us, almost
            everything is a result of or a form of technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the device you are using right now is a form of
            technology made for communication, or the refrigerator in your
            kitchen is a use of science that helps to keep your food fresh and
            cool. With these examples, we see how dependent we are on technology
            and how important it is for us in our daily lives.

            It isn’t easy to imagine our lives without using any form of
            technology. For the smallest of communications, we tend to turn to
            our mobile phones. Even most of the food we eat is packaged in
            factories using various technologies. Thus, imagining a life without
            technology is impossible. It is not only a fact of life but also a
            necessity for all of us.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, the smartphone, that is, a mobile phone which can connect
            to the internet, is becoming one of the fastest-growing and most
            accessible forms of technology around the world. On a smartphone,
            you can click photographs, browse the internet, listen to music, and
            use social media. With the advent of smartphone technology, the
            practical purpose of not only communicating with your friends is
            met, but also so many others, as mentioned.Thus, in today’s world,
            the importance of technology becomes more and more as the years
            pass. Scientists have done so much to advance humans using
            technology, and we still have a long way to go.

            Who Inspires You Essay: In our life, there are many people who have
            inspired us. But who has inspired you the most? These inspiring
            people could be our parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters,
            friends, uncles, teachers, etc. But not only the person whom we know
            personally could inspire us but also the great personalities such as
            famous Indian people, freedom fighters, political leaders,
            cricketers, actors, industrialists, writers, etc. can inspire us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspiration stirs us to additional opportunities by permitting us to
            rise above our standard encounters and constraints. Inspiration
            impels an individual from lack of care to probability and changes
            the manner in which we see our own abilities. inspiration may now
            and again be neglected in light of its slippery nature. Its set of
            experiences of being treated as otherworldly or heavenly hasn’t
            helped the circumstance. Be that as it may, as ongoing exploration
            shows, inspiration can be initiated, caught, and controlled, and it
            majorly affects significant life results. inspiration has three
            principal characteristics: inspiration, amazing quality, and
            approach inspiration.

            Consistently in our life, we get motivated by something or by
            various individuals in our day-to-day existence. In spite of being
            roused by numerous things, we as a whole have someone in our lives
            that motivates us the most. This decision may contrast from one
            individual to another. We as a whole are going ahead in our life to
            get fruitful. It is just the motivation that has an incredible
            effect on our considerations and assists us with accomplishing our
            objectives and getting achievement.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the point when we notice some great characteristics in others, we
            need to do likewise in our life. It adjusts our point of view of
            living. This can possibly happen when we get propelled by
            individuals or things that make us think positively just as inspire
            us to accomplish something. We need it most when we are discouraged
            or miserable by some disappointment or incredible misfortune
            throughout everyday life. It is the motivation just that makes us
            solid again to take on the conflict of our life. Motivation is that
            thought that can change the existence of numerous individuals.
